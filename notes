TYPES ARE THE things with type `type`
Type = {
    id: 
    name: unique with namespace
    namespace: namespace
    properties:[]
    type: "type",
    created
    lastModified

}

Thing
    id
    name
    value
    type(default text)
    created
    lastModified

group also a thing - Array of array of things, this would also represent layout, for example - 


Thing, Thing --> show two things in a row
Thing, Thing, Thing --> show 3 things in a row
Thing - show 1 thing in a row

supports only 2 things in row maximum

create a drag drop page for that?
Or make a label for that?
